# Parallel Programming using Java
This repo contains a set of exercises of parallel java programming.

The projects are provided as fully functioning Maven projects. Maven is a build tool which automatically manages dependencies, source code compilation, test compilation, and test execution. You can use Maven manually from the command line or from the Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEs. While Maven is the most convenient way to build and run projects, you are not required to use Maven if you prefer not to. To that end, we will also provide the necessary JARs with each mini-project if you would rather compile manually or use a different build tool.
